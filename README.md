- 👋 Hi, I’m @xebastien. I have been a scientist working in synchrotrons for almost 10 years. 
- 👀 My research mainly focused on the development of methods for X-ray at-wavelength metrology of optics and imaging. I was for instance one of the very first to work don the use of X-ray near field speckle for these applications.
- 🌱 Although you will be here able to find codes relating to this part of my carrer, I’m currently more orientated toward quantitative finance and portfolio allocation. For this, I also employ ML methods.
- 💞️ I am happy to share some of my scripts especially from my X time. None of them is very clean: most of my codes were made in an attempt to develop and experiment a new approach, so very few of them were actually used more than once. Some parts are somtimes more optimized: these are core or critical functions in term of resources.
- 📫 You an reach me at xebastien@berujon.org, but mind that I might take some time to respond.
